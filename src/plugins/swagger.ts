const DESCRIPTION = `Rewiring Americaâ€™s API offers comprehensive, up-to-date \
information about electrification incentive programs and eligibility.

We are actively developing the "v1" revision of this API. It currently powers \
our [incentives calculator](https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/calculator), \
and we aim for it to be suitable for inclusion in third-party applications.

The "v0" of this API is still available, but deprecated; we plan to remove it \
in the near future, and new applications should not use it.
