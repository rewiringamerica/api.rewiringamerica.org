 * An authority is a government agency, utility, or other organization that

 *
 * The operative distinction here is not the nature of the legal entity, but
 * rather the **geographic coverage** of the incentives the authority offers:
 *
 * - Federal incentives can be available countrywide.
 * - State incentives can be available to any resident of a specific state.
 * - Utility incentives can be available to any customer of a specific utility.
 *   In our data, utilities are scoped to states. If a single utility company
 *   operates across multiple states, we'll represent that as multiple utility
 *   IDs, one in each state.
